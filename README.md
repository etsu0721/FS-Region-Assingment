# FS-Region-Assingment
  My program uses a 9x9 utility matrix. The data comes from a survey I conducted on the employed field men. I solved for the given optimal value by modeling the assignment problem in AMPL (A Mathematical Programming Language).
  
  My program finds all the possible solutions to the assignment problem and then sifts through them to see which ones give the optimal value already determined by AMPL. Each of the solutions that give the optimal value are displayed. A frequency bar chart accompanies each solution so that the user can visualize the frequency of each utility in that solution. This helps the user compare optimal solutions.
