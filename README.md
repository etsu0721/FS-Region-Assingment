# FS-Region-Assingment
## Problem description
The fraternity of Phi Gamma Delta has 152 chapters and 13 colonies across the contiguous United States and into Canada. The fraternity's Interantional Headquarters (IHQ) partitions its chapters and colonies into nine regions and employees nine field men. Each candidate (i.e., field man) is to be assigned to exactly one region. Each region is to be manned by exactly one candidate. The objective is to maximize the total utility of all nine field men. A 9 indicates a most desired preference, and a 1 indicates a least desired preference.

## Program description
The program uses a 9x9 (utility) matrix which is populated with data sourced from a survey given to the employed field men. With the survey data in hand, A Mathematical Programming Language (AMPL) was used to model the assignment problem as an integer programming problem and obtain an optimal value and solution.

The program finds all solutions to the assignment problem that give the optimal value. Each optimal solution is displayed. A bar chart is displayed with each solution to visualize the frequency of each utility value in that solution.
